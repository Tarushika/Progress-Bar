Project Overview:-
Developed an interactive Excel application using VBA, featuring a dynamic progress bar and checkboxes to enhance user interaction and task management. I made a Progress Bar with the help of check box in Excel.

Functionality:- 
Implemented a customizable progress bar to visually track the completion status of stages related to tasks providing real-time feedback to users. Utilized conditional formatting rules to dynamically change colors or styles based on task status, highlighting completed or pending tasks.

Checkbox Integration:-
Incorporated checkboxes to allow users to selectively enable or disable tasks, enhancing flexibility and control within the application. Linked checkbox states with VBA macros to update progress bar status and trigger conditional formatting changes.

Visual Design:- "Designed an intuitive user interface with clear status indicators and interactive controls, including checkbox toggling, progress updates, and visually differentiated task statuses through conditional formatting.

Technical Implementation:-
Utilized VBA's form controls and event-driven programming to create responsive interactions between the progress bar, checkboxes, and conditional formatting rules. Automated updates and status changes based on user inputs and task completion.

Integration:- 
Integrated the progress bar, checkboxes, and conditional formatting seamlessly into Excel workflows, improving task management efficiency and user experience. Ensured compatibility and usability across different Excel versions and environments.
